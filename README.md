# smart-storm

Distributed solution that allows reading measurement data coming from IoT devices. Communication between devices is based on MQTT protocol. Data from devices are sent over Kafka message bus to Spark (real time processing) to get information about incoming weather changes. Distributed image processing is also considered for being used in this project.
